# AutoHire-Pro
AI-Powered Resume Matcher and Interview Scheduler
AutoHire Pro is a smart recruitment automation system designed to simplify and accelerate the candidate shortlisting and interview scheduling process. It uses advanced keyword matching between resumes (PDFs) and job descriptions to identify the best-fit candidates. Candidates scoring 50% or higher(as per requirement) are automatically shortlisted, stored in a database, and scheduled for interviews within a specified time window. Personalized emails are then sent to inform them of their interview details — all without manual intervention. The tool saves valuable time for HR teams and ensures a fair, consistent, and efficient hiring process.
